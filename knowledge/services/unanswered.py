"""Capture knowledge gaps: in-domain questions the bot couldn't answer from data.

The in-domain classification is decided upstream by the answering model itself
(see ``rag.answer_question`` → ``answer_status == "gap"``), because that model is
the one holding the retrieved data and the tenant's identity. So this module does
NOT run a separate filter LLM call — it just:

1. Normalises the question into a stable ``question_key`` for de-duplication.
2. ``get_or_create`` per tenant on ``question_key``; a repeat bumps
   ``occurrences`` and ``last_asked_at`` instead of inserting a duplicate.

Dispatch mode mirrors document ingestion (``UNANSWERED_CAPTURE_MODE``):
``sync`` (default, in-request), ``thread`` (daemon thread), or ``celery``.
Capture must never break a chat reply, so callers wrap it defensively.
